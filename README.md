Stickleback-Tracking
===========================
# Intro
Sticklebacks have been used as model organisms in
behavioural biology for a long time. The goal is to use
quantitative trait locus mapping to identify the genetic
basis for differences in schooling behaviour between
marine and benthic sticklebacks. To do this, we need
to quantify the schooling behaviour of thousands of
fish. We have developed a robust high-throughput video
analysis system that allows us to screen a few thousand
individuals automatically. We propose a non-local
mean background modeling approach that allows us to
detect and track sticklebacks and obtain the schooling
parameters efficiently.
